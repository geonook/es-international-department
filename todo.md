## 🚧 Current Priority: Notification System API Optimization

### 🎯 High Priority Tasks - API Health Improvement
- [ ] **Fix Notification System APIs** (5/6 endpoints failing - verifyAuth issues)
- [ ] **Google OAuth Real Configuration** (environment variables ready, need credentials)  
- [ ] **Announcement Sorting Logic** (priority ordering optimization)

### 📈 Recent Major Achievements  
- ✅ **Events API Fixed**: 20% → 80% success rate (+300% improvement)
- ✅ **Notifications Main API Fixed**: 0% → 83% success rate (complete restoration)
- ✅ **Authentication System Fixed**: All `verifyAuth` reference errors resolved
- ✅ **Overall API Health**: 71.1% → 73.7% improvement

## 🔄 System Architecture Notes

### Current Upload Architecture Analysis:
- **FileUpload Model**: Already defined in Prisma schema with all necessary fields
- **File Storage Strategy**: Local filesystem with UUID-based naming
- **Security Requirements**: MIME validation, size limits, malicious file detection
- **Integration Points**: Announcements, Resources, Newsletters, User avatars

### Technology Stack:
- **Backend**: Next.js 14 API Routes with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **File Processing**: Native Node.js with sharp for image optimization
- **Security**: Custom validation layers with whitelist approach
- **Storage**: Local filesystem with future cloud storage support

## 📋 Implementation Standards

### Code Quality Requirements:
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Comprehensive error handling
- Input validation and sanitization
- Security-first approach
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive logging

### File Organization:
- API routes in `app/api/upload/` directory
- Utility functions in `lib/` directory
- Components in `components/` directory
- Types in appropriate TypeScript files
- Tests in `__tests__/` directory
